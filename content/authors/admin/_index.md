# Biography (replaces the Alex Johnson placeholder)
---

I am a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence applied to Economics at MIAT INRAE. My research focuses on decision-making under risk, insurance markets, and the use of AI tools to model heterogeneous behaviors in economic and environmental settings. I combine econometrics, machine learning, and game theory to study how agents respond to uncertainty and how public policy can be improved through predictive and behavioral modeling.

My main research project involves modeling interactions between the State, insurers, and forest managers, as well as studying risk perception and behavior in forestry. I have a strong interest in applying AI to real-world policy challenges.
