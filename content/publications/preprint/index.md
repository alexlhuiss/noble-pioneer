abstract: This study develops a game-theoretic model to analyze how forest owners and insurance companies interact in a low-coverage insurance market in France. Using data from the Landes de Gascogne, the model shows that few owners choose to insure without public intervention. A Stackelberg framework is then used to evaluate state subsidies on premiums and indemnities, revealing that targeted public support can substantially increase insurance uptake at a limited cost. The work highlights key drivers of insurance demand and provides insights for designing more effective forest risk-management policies.
